## What is Trace OCR?

Trace OCR is a REST API for extracting text from images and PDFs. It combines deep learning-based text detection with text recognition to deliver structured OCR results with confidence scores and bounding box geometry.

Upload a document and get back every word, its location, and how confident the model is — all in a single API call.
